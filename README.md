# ConceptFlow

Interactive animations for understanding complex philosophical and logical concepts.

## Overview

ConceptFlow makes abstract philosophical paradoxes and logical theorems accessible through simple, interactive web animations. Each concept is broken down into digestible steps with visual representations that help learners grasp ideas that traditionally require extensive reading and contemplation.

## Current Animations

### 1. Ship of Theseus
An interactive exploration of the ancient paradox about identity and change. Users can replace ship parts one by one and contemplate whether it remains the same ship.

### 2. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems
A step-by-step visual journey through Kurt Gödel's groundbreaking proof that mathematics contains truths that cannot be proven within the system itself.

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to access the gallery of animations.

## Features

- **No dependencies** - Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Mobile-friendly** - Responsive design works on all devices
- **Educational focus** - Clear explanations with interactive elements
